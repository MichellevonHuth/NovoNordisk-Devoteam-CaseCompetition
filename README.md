# NovoNordisk-Obesity
*Project was developed during The Data Analytics Challenge 2022 in Copenhagen with Novo Nordisk and Inviso by Devoteam, 06-7.11.2022.*

### Background: 
_Novo Nordisk is a global healthcare company, founded in 1923 and headquartered just out- side Copenhagen, Denmark. Novo Nordisk is raising their ambitions to drive change through the development of a new program that can create significant societal impact by focusing on the prevention of obesity among children (age 5 – 9) and adolescents (age 10 – 19) in selected countries across the world._


### Obesity - Drivers and relevance: 
As with many chronic diseases, obesity is more prevalent among people with lower socioeconomic status. This is due to unequal distribution of access to health care, healthy food, and physical activity opportunities.

### GIVEN DATA
- We were provided data in two different categories: 
  1. Overweight and Obesity data
  2. Social, educational, economic, cultural, and environmental factors data
 
## OUR SOLUTION
- We concluded that Novo Nordisk should launch the program in *Malaysia*.
- We filtered the data using Python. 
- We started off by narrowing it down by looking at children with highest BMI rate & having a population higher than 1 million. 
- We looked at 4 external factors when determining which country to choose; 
  1. The projected obesity rate 2030 
  2. Education Levels Enrollment
  3. Healthy Diet Costs
  4. Broadband and Mobile Subscriptions
- We finally displayed and visualised the data using Tableau.  

#### The suggested *program* to launch in Malaysia
 - A comprehensive education programme:
 1. In schools – targeting the youngest (5-9 y/o) - where prevalence of obesity is highest
 2. In urban, rather than rural, environments – where obesity rates are highest
 3. Targeting families in the bottom quartile of household income – where obesity rates are highest
 4. In ethnically and culturally appropriate ways - targeting ethnic groups where obesity rates are highest

- For parents:
1. Nudging personal decision-making around diet when the government doesn't make it easy 
2. Working with local stakeholders – role of 'community pharmacists' in disseminating information

- Cost: 
1. Numerous studies across the US and Europe on sustainable programs guiding children towards healthier choices average ~$30 per student, per year
